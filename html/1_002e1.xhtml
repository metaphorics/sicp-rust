<h3 class="section" id="The-Elements-of-Programming"><span>1.1 The Elements of Programming<a class="copiable-link" href="#The-Elements-of-Programming"> &#182;</a></span></h3>

<p>A powerful programming language is more than just a means for instructing a
computer to perform tasks.  The language also serves as a framework within
which we organize our ideas about processes.  Thus, when we describe a
language, we should pay particular attention to the means that the language
provides for combining simple ideas to form more complex ideas.  Every powerful
language has three mechanisms for accomplishing this:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li><b class="b">primitive expressions</b>,
which represent the simplest entities the language is concerned with,

</li><li><b class="b">means of combination</b>,
by which compound elements are built from simpler ones, and

</li><li><b class="b">means of abstraction</b>,
by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units.

</li></ul>

<p>In programming, we deal with two kinds of elements: procedures and data. (Later
we will discover that they are really not so distinct.)  Informally, data is
&#8220;stuff&#8221; that we want to manipulate, and procedures are descriptions of the
rules for manipulating the data.  Thus, any powerful programming language
should be able to describe primitive data and primitive procedures and should
have methods for combining and abstracting procedures and data.
</p>
<p>In this chapter we will deal only with simple numerical data so that we can
focus on the rules for building procedures.<a class="footnote" id="DOCF1" href="#FOOT1"><sup>1</sup></a> In later chapters we will see that these
same rules allow us to build procedures to manipulate compound data as well.
</p>

<div class="subsection-level-extent" id="g_t1_002e1_002e1">
<h4 class="subsection" id="Expressions"><span>1.1.1 Expressions<a class="copiable-link" href="#Expressions"> &#182;</a></span></h4>

<p>One easy way to get started at programming is to examine some typical
interactions with the Rust REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop).  Imagine that
you are sitting at a computer terminal.  You type an <a class="index-entry-id" id="index-expression"></a>
<em class="dfn">expression</em>, and
the interpreter responds by displaying the result of its <a class="index-entry-id" id="index-evaluating"></a>
<em class="dfn">evaluating</em>
that expression.
</p>
<p>One kind of primitive expression you might type is a number.  (More precisely,
the expression that you type consists of the numerals that represent the number
in base 10.)  If you present Rust with a number
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">486
</pre></div>

<p>the interpreter will respond by printing<a class="footnote" id="DOCF2" href="#FOOT2"><sup>2</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted"><i class="i">486</i>
</pre></div>

<p>Expressions representing numbers may be combined with operators
(such as <code class="code">+</code> or <code class="code">*</code>) to form a
compound expression that represents the application of the operator to those
numbers.  For example<!-- /@w -->:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">137 + 349
// =&gt; 486

1000 - 334
// =&gt; 666

5 * 99
// =&gt; 495

10 / 5
// =&gt; 2

2.7 + 10.0
// =&gt; 12.7
</pre></div>

<p>Expressions such as these, which combine operators with operands, are called
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-compound-expressions"></a>
<em class="dfn">compound expressions</em>.  Rust uses standard mathematical <a class="index-entry-id" id="index-infix-notation"></a>
<em class="dfn">infix notation</em>,
where the operator appears between its operands.  The
value of a compound expression is obtained by applying the operator to the
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-arguments"></a>
<em class="dfn">arguments</em> that are the values of the operands.
</p>
<p>This convention of placing the operator between operands is known as
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-infix-notation-1"></a>
<em class="dfn">infix notation</em>, which follows customary mathematical convention.
Infix notation works naturally with binary operators, and can be extended
to handle multiple operands through chaining, as in
the following examples:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">21 + 35 + 12 + 7
// =&gt; 75

25 * 4 * 12
// =&gt; 1200
</pre></div>

<p>No ambiguity can arise, because Rust follows standard operator precedence rules
(multiplication and division before addition and subtraction), and parentheses can
be used to override the default precedence.
</p>
<p>Infix notation extends naturally to allow expressions to be <i class="i">nested</i>, that is,
to have compound expressions whose operands are themselves compound expressions:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(3 * 5) + (10 - 6)
// =&gt; 19
</pre></div>

<p>There is no limit (in principle) to the depth of such nesting and to the
overall complexity of the expressions that Rust can evaluate.
It is we humans who get confused by still relatively simple expressions such as
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(3 * ((2 * 4) + (3 + 5))) + ((10 - 7) + 6)
</pre></div>

<p>which the interpreter would readily evaluate to be 57.  We can help ourselves
by writing such an expression in the form
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(3 * ((2 * 4) +
      (3 + 5))) +
((10 - 7) + 6)
</pre></div>

<p>following a formatting convention known as <a class="index-entry-id" id="index-pretty_002dprinting"></a>
<em class="dfn">pretty-printing</em>, in which
each long expression is written so that the operands are aligned vertically.
The resulting indentations display clearly the structure of the
expression.<a class="footnote" id="DOCF3" href="#FOOT3"><sup>3</sup></a>
</p>
<p>Even with complex expressions, the interpreter always operates in the same
basic cycle: It reads an expression from the terminal, evaluates the
expression, and prints the result.  This mode of operation is often expressed
by saying that the interpreter runs in a <a class="index-entry-id" id="index-read_002deval_002dprint-loop"></a>
<em class="dfn">read-eval-print loop</em>.
Observe in particular that it is not necessary to explicitly instruct the
interpreter to print the value of the expression.<a class="footnote" id="DOCF4" href="#FOOT4"><sup>4</sup></a>

<h4 class="subsection" id="Naming-and-the-Environment"><span>1.1.2 Naming and the Environment<a class="copiable-link" href="#Naming-and-the-Environment"> &#182;</a></span></h4>

<p>A critical aspect of a programming language is the means it provides for using
names to refer to computational objects.  We say that the name identifies a
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-variable"></a>
<em class="dfn">variable</em> whose <a class="index-entry-id" id="index-value"></a>
<em class="dfn">value</em> is the object.
</p>
<p>In Rust, we name things with <code class="code">let</code> bindings.  Typing
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">let size = 2;
</pre></div>

<p>causes the interpreter to associate the value 2 with the name
<code class="code">size</code>.<a class="footnote" id="DOCF5" href="#FOOT5"><sup>5</sup></a> Once
the name <code class="code">size</code> has been associated with the number 2, we can refer to the
value 2 by name:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">size
// =&gt; 2

5 * size
// =&gt; 10
</pre></div>

<p>Here are further examples of the use of <code class="code">let</code>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">let pi = 3.14159;
let radius = 10.0;

pi * (radius * radius)
// =&gt; 314.159

let circumference = 2.0 * pi * radius;

circumference
// =&gt; 62.8318
</pre></div>

<p><code class="code">let</code> bindings are our language&#8217;s simplest means of abstraction, for they allow us
to use simple names to refer to the results of compound operations, such as the
<code class="code">circumference</code> computed above.  In general, computational objects may
have very complex structures, and it would be extremely inconvenient to have to
remember and repeat their details each time we want to use them.  Indeed,
complex programs are constructed by building, step by step, computational
objects of increasing complexity. The REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) makes this step-by-step
program construction particularly convenient because name-object associations
can be created incrementally in successive interactions.  This feature
encourages the incremental development and testing of programs and is largely
responsible for the fact that a Rust program usually consists of a large number
of relatively simple functions.
</p>
<p>It should be clear that the possibility of associating values with symbols and
later retrieving them means that the interpreter must maintain some sort of
memory that keeps track of the name-object pairs.  This memory is called the
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-environment"></a>
<em class="dfn">environment</em> (more precisely the <a class="index-entry-id" id="index-global-environment"></a>
<em class="dfn">global environment</em>, since
we will see later that a computation may involve a number of different
environments).<a class="footnote" id="DOCF6" href="#FOOT6"><sup>6</sup></a>

<h4 class="subsection" id="Evaluating-Combinations"><span>1.1.3 Evaluating Combinations<a class="copiable-link" href="#Evaluating-Combinations"> &#182;</a></span></h4>

<p>One of our goals in this chapter is to isolate issues about thinking
procedurally.  As a case in point, let us consider that, in evaluating
combinations, the interpreter is itself following a procedure.
</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
<p>To evaluate a combination, do the following:
</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li> Evaluate the subexpressions of the combination.

</li><li> Apply the procedure that is the value of the operator subexpression to the
arguments that are the values of the operand subexpressions.

</li></ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Even this simple rule illustrates some important points about processes in
general.  First, observe that the first step dictates that in order to
accomplish the evaluation process for a combination we must first perform the
evaluation process on each element of the combination.  Thus, the evaluation
rule is <a class="index-entry-id" id="index-recursive"></a>
<em class="dfn">recursive</em> in nature; that is, it includes, as one of its
steps, the need to invoke the rule itself.<a class="footnote" id="DOCF7" href="#FOOT7"><sup>7</sup></a>
</p>
<p>Notice how succinctly the idea of recursion can be used to express what, in the
case of a deeply nested combination, would otherwise be viewed as a rather
complicated process.  For example, evaluating
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(2 + (4 * 6)) * (3 + 5 + 7)
</pre></div>

<p>requires that the evaluation rule be applied to four different combinations.
We can obtain a picture of this process by representing the combination in the
form of a tree, as shown in <a class="ref" href="#Figure-1_002e1">Figure 1.1</a>.  Each combination is represented
by a node with branches corresponding to the operator and the operands of the
combination stemming from it.  The terminal nodes (that is, nodes with no
branches stemming from them) represent either operators or numbers.  Viewing
evaluation in terms of the tree, we can imagine that the values of the operands
percolate upward, starting from the terminal nodes and then combining at higher
and higher levels.  In general, we shall see that recursion is a very powerful
technique for dealing with hierarchical, treelike objects.  In fact, the
&#8220;percolate values upward&#8221; form of the evaluation rule is an example of a
general kind of process known as <a class="index-entry-id" id="index-tree-accumulation"></a>
<em class="dfn">tree accumulation</em>.
</p>
<div class="float">
<a class="anchor" id="Figure-1_002e1"></a><img class="image" src="fig/chap1/Fig1.1g.std.svg" alt="fig/chap1/Fig1.1g" />
<div class="caption"><p><strong class="strong">Figure 1.1:</strong> Tree representation, showing the value of each subcombination.</p></div></div>
<p>Next, observe that the repeated application of the first step brings us to the
point where we need to evaluate, not combinations, but primitive expressions
such as numerals, built-in operators, or other names.  We take care of the
primitive cases by stipulating that
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>the values of numerals are the numbers that they name,

</li><li>the values of built-in operators are the machine instruction sequences that
carry out the corresponding operations, and

</li><li>the values of other names are the objects associated with those names in the
environment.

</li></ul>

<p>We may regard the second rule as a special case of the third one by stipulating
that symbols such as <code class="code">+</code> and <code class="code">*</code> are also included in the global
environment, and are associated with the sequences of machine instructions that
are their &#8220;values.&#8221;  The key point to notice is the role of the environment
in determining the meaning of the symbols in expressions.  In an interactive
language such as Lisp, it is meaningless to speak of the value of an expression
such as <code class="code">(+ x 1)</code> without specifying any information about the environment
that would provide a meaning for the symbol <code class="code">x</code> (or even for the symbol
<code class="code">+</code>).  As we shall see in <a class="ref" href="Chapter-3.xhtml">Modularity, Objects, and State</a>, the general notion of the
environment as providing a context in which evaluation takes place will play an
important role in our understanding of program execution.
</p>
<p>Notice that the evaluation rule given above does not handle definitions.  For
instance, executing <code class="code">let x = 3;</code> does not apply a function to arguments.
The purpose of the <code class="code">let</code> statement is precisely to associate
<code class="code">x</code> with a value.
</p>
<p>In Rust, we distinguish between <a class="index-entry-id" id="index-expressions"></a>
<em class="dfn">expressions</em>, which evaluate to a value,
and <a class="index-entry-id" id="index-statements"></a>
<em class="dfn">statements</em>, which perform an action (like binding a variable) but
do not return a value (or return the unit type <code class="code">()</code>). <code class="code">let</code> bindings are
statements. This distinction is important because only expressions can be used
where a value is expected (like inside a math operation).
</p>
<p>This structure differs from Lisp&#8217;s concept of <a class="index-entry-id" id="index-special-forms"></a>
<em class="dfn">special forms</em>, where
everything is a list but some lists have special evaluation rules. Rust has a
richer syntax with keywords and specific structures for control flow and definitions.
The various kinds of expressions and statements constitute the syntax of the
programming language.  Rust&#8217;s syntax is more complex than Lisp&#8217;s but provides
clear visual cues for different constructs.<a class="footnote" id="DOCF8" href="#FOOT8"><sup>8</sup></a>

<h4 class="subsection" id="Compound-Procedures"><span>1.1.4 Compound Procedures<a class="copiable-link" href="#Compound-Procedures"> &#182;</a></span></h4>

<p>We have identified in Rust some of the elements that must appear in any
powerful programming language:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>Numbers and arithmetic operations are primitive data and procedures.

</li><li>Nesting of combinations provides a means of combining operations.

</li><li>Definitions that associate names with values provide a limited means of
abstraction.

</li></ul>

<p>Now we will learn about <a class="index-entry-id" id="index-procedure-definitions"></a>
<em class="dfn">procedure definitions</em>, a much more powerful
abstraction technique by which a compound operation can be given a name and
then referred to as a unit.
</p>
<p>We begin by examining how to express the idea of &#8220;squaring.&#8221;  We might say,
&#8220;To square something, multiply it by itself.&#8221;  This is expressed in our
language as
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">fn square(x: i64) -&gt; i64 { x * x }
</pre></div>

<p>We can understand this in the following way:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">fn square(x: i64) -&gt; i64 { x   *   x }
|    |    |         |      |   |   |
|    |    |         |       To multiply
|    |    |         Return type (64-bit integer)
|    |    Parameter with type annotation
|    Function name
Function definition keyword
</pre></div>

<p>We have here a <a class="index-entry-id" id="index-compound-procedure"></a>
<em class="dfn">compound procedure</em>, which has been given the name
<code class="code">square</code>.  The procedure represents the operation of multiplying something
by itself.  The thing to be multiplied is given a local name, <code class="code">x</code>, which
plays the same role that a pronoun plays in natural language.  Evaluating the
definition creates this compound procedure and associates it with the name
<code class="code">square</code>.<a class="footnote" id="DOCF9" href="#FOOT9"><sup>9</sup></a>
</p>
<p>The general form of a procedure definition is
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">fn ⟨<var class="var">name</var>⟩(⟨<var class="var">formal parameters</var>⟩) -&gt; ⟨<var class="var">return type</var>⟩ { ⟨<var class="var">body</var>⟩ }
</pre></div>

<p>The <code class="code">⟨</code><var class="var">name</var><code class="code">⟩</code> is a symbol to be associated with the procedure definition in
the environment.<a class="footnote" id="DOCF10" href="#FOOT10"><sup>10</sup></a> The <code class="code">⟨</code><var class="var">formal<!-- /@w --> parameters<!-- /@w --></var><code class="code">⟩</code>
are the names used within the body of the procedure to refer to
the corresponding arguments of the procedure, each with its type annotation.
The <code class="code">⟨</code><var class="var">return<!-- /@w --> type<!-- /@w --></var><code class="code">⟩</code> specifies the type of value the procedure will return.
The <code class="code">⟨</code><var class="var">body</var><code class="code">⟩</code> is an
expression that will yield the value of the procedure application when the
formal parameters are replaced by the actual arguments to which the procedure
is applied.<a class="footnote" id="DOCF11" href="#FOOT11"><sup>11</sup></a>  The <code class="code">⟨</code><var class="var">name</var><code class="code">⟩</code> and
the <code class="code">⟨</code><var class="var">formal parameters</var><code class="code">⟩</code> are grouped within parentheses, just as they
would be in an actual call to the procedure being defined.
</p>
<p>Having defined <code class="code">square</code>, we can now use it:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">square(21)
<i class="i">441</i>

square(2 + 5)
<i class="i">49</i>

square(square(3))
<i class="i">81</i>
</pre></div>

<p>We can also use <code class="code">square</code> as a building block in defining other procedures.
For example, <em class="math">x^2 + y^2</em> can be expressed as
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">square(x) + square(y)
</pre></div>

<p>We can easily define a procedure <code class="code">sum_of_squares</code> that, given any two
numbers as arguments, produces the sum of their squares:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">fn sum_of_squares(x: i64, y: i64) -&gt; i64 {
    square(x) + square(y)
}

sum_of_squares(3, 4)
<i class="i">25</i>
</pre></div>

<p>Now we can use <code class="code">sum_of_squares</code> as a building block in constructing
further procedures:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">fn f(a: i64) -&gt; i64 {
    sum_of_squares(a + 1, a * 2)
}

f(5)
<i class="i">136</i>
</pre></div>

<p>Compound procedures are used in exactly the same way as primitive procedures.
Indeed, one could not tell by looking at the definition of
<code class="code">sum_of_squares</code> given above whether <code class="code">square</code> was built into the
language, like <code class="code">+</code> and <code class="code">*</code>, or defined as a compound procedure.

<h4 class="subsection" id="The-Substitution-Model-for-Procedure-Application"><span>1.1.5 The Substitution Model for Procedure Application<a class="copiable-link" href="#The-Substitution-Model-for-Procedure-Application"> &#182;</a></span></h4>

<p>To evaluate a combination whose operator names a compound procedure, the
interpreter follows much the same process as for combinations whose operators
name primitive procedures, which we described in <a class="ref" href="#g_t1_002e1_002e3">Evaluating Combinations</a>.  That is,
the interpreter evaluates the elements of the combination and applies the
procedure (which is the value of the operator of the combination) to the
arguments (which are the values of the operands of the combination).
</p>
<p>We can assume that the mechanism for applying primitive procedures to arguments
is built into the interpreter.  For compound procedures, the application
process is as follows:
</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
<p>To apply a compound procedure to arguments, evaluate the body of the procedure
with each formal parameter bound to the corresponding argument.
</p></blockquote>

<p>To illustrate this process, let&#8217;s evaluate the combination
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">f(5)
</pre></div>

<p>where <code class="code">f</code> is the procedure defined in <a class="ref" href="#g_t1_002e1_002e4">Compound Procedures</a>.  We begin by
retrieving the body of <code class="code">f</code>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">sum_of_squares(a + 1, a * 2)
</pre></div>

<p>Then we replace the formal parameter <code class="code">a</code> by the argument 5:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">sum_of_squares(5 + 1, 5 * 2)
</pre></div>

<p>Thus the problem reduces to the evaluation of a combination with two operands
and an operator <code class="code">sum_of_squares</code>.  Evaluating this combination involves
three subproblems.  We must evaluate the operator to get the procedure to be
applied, and we must evaluate the operands to get the arguments.  Now <code class="code">5 +
1</code> produces 6 and <code class="code">5 * 2</code> produces 10, so we must apply the
<code class="code">sum_of_squares</code> procedure to 6 and 10.  These values are substituted for
the formal parameters <code class="code">x</code> and <code class="code">y</code> in the body of
<code class="code">sum_of_squares</code>, reducing the expression to
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">square(6) + square(10)
</pre></div>

<p>If we use the definition of <code class="code">square</code>, this reduces to
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(6 * 6) + (10 * 10)
</pre></div>

<p>which reduces by multiplication to
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">36 + 100
</pre></div>

<p>and finally to
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">136
</pre></div>

<p>The process we have just described is called the <a class="index-entry-id" id="index-substitution-model"></a>
<em class="dfn">substitution model</em>
for procedure application.  It can be taken as a model that determines the
&#8220;meaning&#8221; of procedure application, insofar as the procedures in this chapter
are concerned.  However, there are two points that should be stressed:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>The purpose of the substitution is to help us think about procedure
application, not to provide a description of how the interpreter really works.
Typical interpreters do not evaluate procedure applications by manipulating the
text of a procedure to substitute values for the formal parameters.  In
practice, the &#8220;substitution&#8221; is accomplished by using a local environment for
the formal parameters.  We will discuss this more fully in <a class="ref" href="Chapter-3.xhtml">Modularity, Objects, and State</a> and
<a class="ref" href="Chapter-4.xhtml">Metalinguistic Abstraction</a> when we examine the implementation of an interpreter in detail.

</li><li>Over the course of this book, we will present a sequence of increasingly
elaborate models of how interpreters work, culminating with a complete
implementation of an interpreter and compiler in <a class="ref" href="Chapter-5.xhtml">Computing with Register Machines</a>.  The
substitution model is only the first of these models&#8212;a way to get started
thinking formally about the evaluation process.  In general, when modeling
phenomena in science and engineering, we begin with simplified, incomplete
models.  As we examine things in greater detail, these simple models become
inadequate and must be replaced by more refined models.  The substitution model
is no exception.  In particular, when we address in <a class="ref" href="Chapter-3.xhtml">Modularity, Objects, and State</a> the use of
procedures with &#8220;mutable data,&#8221; we will see that the substitution model
breaks down and must be replaced by a more complicated model of procedure
application.

</li></ul>

<h4 class="subsubheading" id="Applicative-order-versus-normal-order"><span>Applicative order versus normal order<a class="copiable-link" href="#Applicative-order-versus-normal-order"> &#182;</a></span></h4>

<p>According to the description of evaluation given in <a class="ref" href="#g_t1_002e1_002e3">Evaluating Combinations</a>, the
interpreter first evaluates the operator and operands and then applies the
resulting procedure to the resulting arguments.  This is not the only way to
perform evaluation.  An alternative evaluation model would not evaluate the
operands until their values were needed.  Instead it would first substitute
operand expressions for parameters until it obtained an expression involving
only primitive operators, and would then perform the evaluation.  If we used
this method, the evaluation of <code class="code">f(5)</code> would proceed according to the
sequence of expansions
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">sum_of_squares(5 + 1, 5 * 2)

square(5 + 1) + square(5 * 2)

(5 + 1) * (5 + 1) + (5 * 2) * (5 * 2)
</pre></div>

<p>followed by the reductions
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(6 * 6) + (10 * 10)

36 + 100

136
</pre></div>

<p>This gives the same answer as our previous evaluation model, but the process is
different.  In particular, the evaluations of <code class="code">5 + 1</code> and <code class="code">5 * 2</code>
are each performed twice here, corresponding to the reduction of the expression
<code class="code">x * x</code> with <code class="code">x</code> replaced respectively by <code class="code">5 + 1</code> and
<code class="code">5 * 2</code>.
</p>
<p>This alternative &#8220;fully expand and then reduce&#8221; evaluation method is known as
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-normal_002dorder-evaluation"></a>
<em class="dfn">normal-order evaluation</em>, in contrast to the &#8220;evaluate the arguments
and then apply&#8221; method that the interpreter actually uses, which is called
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-applicative_002dorder-evaluation"></a>
<em class="dfn">applicative-order evaluation</em>.  It can be shown that, for procedure
applications that can be modeled using substitution (including all the
procedures in the first two chapters of this book) and that yield legitimate
values, normal-order and applicative-order evaluation produce the same value.
(See <a class="ref" href="#Exercise-1_002e5">Exercise 1.5</a> for an instance of an &#8220;illegitimate&#8221; value where
normal-order and applicative-order evaluation do not give the same result.)
</p>
<p>Rust uses applicative-order evaluation, partly because of the additional
efficiency obtained from avoiding multiple evaluations of expressions such as
those illustrated with <code class="code">5 + 1</code> and <code class="code">5 * 2</code> above and, more
significantly, because normal-order evaluation becomes much more complicated to
deal with when we leave the realm of procedures that can be modeled by
substitution.  On the other hand, normal-order evaluation can be an extremely
valuable tool, and we will investigate some of its implications in <a class="ref" href="Chapter-3.xhtml">Modularity, Objects, and State</a> and <a class="ref" href="Chapter-4.xhtml">Metalinguistic Abstraction</a>.

<h4 class="subsection" id="Conditional-Expressions-and-Predicates"><span>1.1.6 Conditional Expressions and Predicates<a class="copiable-link" href="#Conditional-Expressions-and-Predicates"> &#182;</a></span></h4>

<p>The expressive power of the class of procedures that we can define at this
point is very limited, because we have no way to make tests and to perform
different operations depending on the result of a test.  For instance, we
cannot define a procedure that computes the absolute value of a number by
testing whether the number is positive, negative, or zero and taking different
actions in the different cases according to the rule

\[ % :1:

\left|{x}\right| \; = \;
  \left\{ 
    \begin{array}{rll}	 	 
       x &amp; \;\text{if} &amp; x \gt 0, \\
       0 &amp; \;\text{if} &amp; x  =  0, \\
      -x &amp; \;\text{if} &amp; x \lt 0. 
    \end{array} 
  \right. 
\]

This construct is called a <a class="index-entry-id" id="index-case-analysis"></a>
<em class="dfn">case analysis</em>, and there is a special form
in Rust for notating such a case analysis.  It can be expressed using <code class="code">if/else if/else</code>
chains as follows:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">fn abs(x: i64) -&gt; i64 {
    if x &gt; 0 {
        x
    } else if x == 0 {
        0
    } else {
        -x
    }
}
</pre></div>

<p>The general form of a conditional expression is
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">if ⟨<var class="var">p₁</var>⟩ {
    ⟨<var class="var">e₁</var>⟩
} else if ⟨<var class="var">p₂</var>⟩ {
    ⟨<var class="var">e₂</var>⟩
}
<span class="r">…</span>
else {
    ⟨<var class="var">eₙ</var>⟩
}
</pre></div>

<p>consisting of the keyword <code class="code">if</code> followed by a condition and a block,
optionally followed by <code class="code">else if</code> branches and a final <code class="code">else</code> branch.
Each conditional expression is a
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-predicate"></a>
<em class="dfn">predicate</em>&#8212;that is, an expression whose value is interpreted as
either true or false.<a class="footnote" id="DOCF12" href="#FOOT12"><sup>12</sup></a>
</p>
<p>Conditional expressions are evaluated as follows.  The predicate <em class="math">{⟨p_1⟩}</em> is
evaluated first.  If its value is false, then <em class="math">{⟨p_2⟩}</em> is evaluated.  If
<em class="math">{⟨p_2⟩}</em>&#8217;s value is also false, then <em class="math">{⟨p_3⟩}</em> is evaluated.  This process
continues until a predicate is found whose value is true, in which case the
interpreter returns the value of the corresponding <a class="index-entry-id" id="index-consequent-expression"></a>
<em class="dfn">consequent expression</em>
<em class="math">{⟨e⟩}</em> as the value of the conditional expression.
If none of the <em class="math">{⟨p⟩}</em>&#8217;s is found to be true and there is a final <code class="code">else</code>
branch, that branch&#8217;s value is returned.
</p>
<p>The word <a class="index-entry-id" id="index-predicate-1"></a>
<em class="dfn">predicate</em> is used for functions that return true or false,
as well as for expressions that evaluate to true or false.  The absolute-value
function <code class="code">abs</code> makes use of the primitive predicates <code class="code">&gt;</code>, <code class="code">&lt;</code>,
and <code class="code">==</code>.<a class="footnote" id="DOCF13" href="#FOOT13"><sup>13</sup></a> These take two numbers as arguments and test whether the first
number is, respectively, greater than, less than, or equal to the second
number, returning true or false accordingly.
</p>
<p>Another way to write the absolute-value function is
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">fn abs(x: i64) -&gt; i64 {
    if x &lt; 0 {
        -x
    } else {
        x
    }
}
</pre></div>

<p>which could be expressed in English as &#8220;If <em class="math">x</em> is less than zero return
<em class="math">{-x}</em>; otherwise return <em class="math">x</em>.&#8221;  <code class="code">else</code> is a keyword in Rust that
provides the default branch of a conditional.  This
causes the conditional to return as its value the value of the
<code class="code">else</code> block whenever all previous conditions have been false.
</p>
<p>Here is yet another way to write the absolute-value function:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">fn abs(x: i64) -&gt; i64 {
    if x &lt; 0 { -x } else { x }
}
</pre></div>

<p>This uses the <code class="code">if</code> expression, which can
be used when there are precisely two cases in the case analysis.  The general
form of an <code class="code">if</code> expression is
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">if ⟨<var class="var">predicate</var>⟩ { ⟨<var class="var">consequent</var>⟩ } else { ⟨<var class="var">alternative</var>⟩ }
</pre></div>

<p>To evaluate an <code class="code">if</code> expression, the interpreter starts by evaluating the
<code class="code">⟨</code><var class="var">predicate</var><code class="code">⟩</code> part of the expression.  If the <code class="code">⟨</code><var class="var">predicate</var><code class="code">⟩</code> evaluates
to a true value, the interpreter then evaluates the <code class="code">⟨</code><var class="var">consequent</var><code class="code">⟩</code> and
returns its value.  Otherwise it evaluates the <code class="code">⟨</code><var class="var">alternative</var><code class="code">⟩</code> and returns
its value.<a class="footnote" id="DOCF14" href="#FOOT14"><sup>14</sup></a>
</p>
<p>In addition to primitive predicates such as <code class="code">&lt;</code>, <code class="code">==</code>, and <code class="code">&gt;</code>,
there are logical composition operations, which enable us to construct compound
predicates.  The three most frequently used are these:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li><code class="code">⟨<var class="var">e₁</var>⟩ &amp;&amp; <span class="r">…</span> &amp;&amp; ⟨<var class="var">eₙ</var>⟩</code>

<p>The interpreter evaluates the expressions <code class="code">⟨</code><var class="var">e</var><code class="code">⟩</code> one at a time, in
left-to-right order.  If any <code class="code">⟨</code><var class="var">e</var><code class="code">⟩</code> evaluates to false, the value of the
<code class="code">&amp;&amp;</code> expression is false, and the rest of the <code class="code">⟨</code><var class="var">e</var><code class="code">⟩</code>&#8217;s are not
evaluated.  If all <code class="code">⟨</code><var class="var">e</var><code class="code">⟩</code>&#8217;s evaluate to true values, the value of the
<code class="code">&amp;&amp;</code> expression is true.
</p>
</li><li><code class="code">⟨<var class="var">e₁</var>⟩ || <span class="r">…</span> || ⟨<var class="var">eₙ</var>⟩</code>

<p>The interpreter evaluates the expressions <code class="code">⟨</code><var class="var">e</var><code class="code">⟩</code> one at a time, in
left-to-right order.  If any <code class="code">⟨</code><var class="var">e</var><code class="code">⟩</code> evaluates to a true value, true is
returned as the value of the <code class="code">||</code> expression, and the rest of the
<code class="code">⟨</code><var class="var">e</var><code class="code">⟩</code>&#8217;s are not evaluated.  If all <code class="code">⟨</code><var class="var">e</var><code class="code">⟩</code>&#8217;s evaluate to false, the value
of the <code class="code">||</code> expression is false.
</p>
</li><li><code class="code">!⟨<var class="var">e</var>⟩</code>

<p>The value of a <code class="code">!</code> expression is true when the expression <code class="code">⟨</code><var class="var">e</var><code class="code">⟩</code>
evaluates to false, and false otherwise.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Notice that <code class="code">&amp;&amp;</code> and <code class="code">||</code> use short-circuit evaluation, meaning
the subexpressions are not necessarily all evaluated.  <code class="code">!</code> is an
ordinary operator that always evaluates its operand.
</p>
<p>As an example of how these are used, the condition that a number <em class="math">x</em> be in
the range <em class="math">5 &lt; x &lt; 10</em> may be expressed as
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">x &gt; 5 &amp;&amp; x &lt; 10
</pre></div>

<p>As another example, we can define a predicate to test whether one number is
greater than or equal to another as
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">fn gte(x: i64, y: i64) -&gt; bool {
    x &gt; y || x == y
}
</pre></div>

<p>or alternatively as
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">fn gte(x: i64, y: i64) -&gt; bool {
    !(x &lt; y)
}
</pre></div>

<p>Procedures, as introduced above, are much like ordinary mathematical functions.
They specify a value that is determined by one or more parameters.  But there
is an important difference between mathematical functions and computer
procedures.  Procedures must be effective.
</p>
<p>As a case in point, consider the problem of computing square roots.  We can
define the square-root function as

\[ % :3:

\sqrt{x} \;\; = \;\; {\text{the} \;\; y} \;\;
{\text{such that}} \;\; {y \ge 0} \;\; {\text{and} \;\; y^2 = x.}
\]

This describes a perfectly legitimate mathematical function.  We could use it
to recognize whether one number is the square root of another, or to derive
facts about square roots in general.  On the other hand, the definition does
not describe a procedure.  Indeed, it tells us almost nothing about how to
actually find the square root of a given number.  It will not help matters to
rephrase this definition in pseudo-Rust:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">fn sqrt(x: f64) -&gt; f64 {
    // the y such that y &gt;= 0.0 &amp;&amp; square(y) == x
    unimplemented!()
}
</pre></div>

<p>This only begs the question.
</p>
<p>The contrast between function and procedure is a reflection of the general
distinction between describing properties of things and describing how to do
things, or, as it is sometimes referred to, the distinction between declarative
knowledge and imperative knowledge.  In mathematics we are usually concerned
with declarative (what is) descriptions, whereas in computer science we are
usually concerned with imperative (how to) descriptions.<a class="footnote" id="DOCF15" href="#FOOT15"><sup>15</sup></a>
</p>
<p>How does one compute square roots?  The most common way is to use Newton&#8217;s
method of successive approximations, which says that whenever we have a guess
<em class="math">y</em> for the value of the square root of a number <em class="math">x</em>, we can perform a
simple manipulation to get a better guess (one closer to the actual square
root) by averaging <em class="math">y</em> with <em class="math">{x / y}</em>.<a class="footnote" id="DOCF16" href="#FOOT16"><sup>16</sup></a> 
For example, we can compute the square root of 2 as follows.
Suppose our initial guess is 1:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">Guess     Quotient      Average

1         (2/1)  = 2    ((2 + 1)/2)  = 1.5

1.5       (2/1.5)       ((1.3333 + 1.5)/2)
            = 1.3333      = 1.4167

1.4167    (2/1.4167)    ((1.4167 + 1.4118)/2) 
            = 1.4118      = 1.4142  

1.4142    ...           ...
</pre></div>

<p>Continuing this process, we obtain better and better approximations to the
square root.
</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s formalize the process in terms of procedures.  We start with a value
for the radicand (the number whose square root we are trying to compute) and a
value for the guess.  If the guess is good enough for our purposes, we are
done; if not, we must repeat the process with an improved guess.  We write this
basic strategy as a procedure:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">fn sqrt_iter(guess: f64, x: f64) -&gt; f64 {
    if good_enough(guess, x) {
        guess
    } else {
        sqrt_iter(improve(guess, x), x)
    }
}
</pre></div>

<p>A guess is improved by averaging it with the quotient of the radicand and the
old guess:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">fn improve(guess: f64, x: f64) -&gt; f64 {
    average(guess, x / guess)
}
</pre></div>

<p>where
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">fn average(x: f64, y: f64) -&gt; f64 {
    (x + y) / 2.0
}
</pre></div>

<p>We also have to say what we mean by &#8220;good enough.&#8221;  The following will do for
illustration, but it is not really a very good test.  (See <a class="ref" href="#Exercise-1_002e7">Exercise 1.7</a>.)  
The idea is to improve the answer until it is close
enough so that its square differs from the radicand by less than a
predetermined tolerance (here 0.001):<a class="footnote" id="DOCF17" href="#FOOT17"><sup>17</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">fn good_enough(guess: f64, x: f64) -&gt; bool {
    (guess.powi(2) - x).abs() &lt; 0.001
}
</pre></div>

<p>Finally, we need a way to get started.  For instance, we can always guess that
the square root of any number is 1.0:<a class="footnote" id="DOCF18" href="#FOOT18"><sup>18</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">fn sqrt(x: f64) -&gt; f64 {
    sqrt_iter(1.0, x)
}
</pre></div>

<p>If we type these definitions to the interpreter, we can use <code class="code">sqrt</code> just as
we can use any procedure:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">sqrt(9.0)
// =&gt; 3.00009155413138

sqrt(100.0 + 37.0)
// =&gt; 11.704699917758145

sqrt(sqrt(2.0) + sqrt(3.0))
// =&gt; 1.7739279023207892

square(sqrt(1000.0))
// =&gt; 1000.000369924366
</pre></div>

<p>The <code class="code">sqrt</code> program also illustrates that the simple procedural language we
have introduced so far is sufficient for writing any purely numerical program
that one could write in, say, C or Pascal.  This might seem surprising, since
we have not included in our language any iterative (looping) constructs that
direct the computer to do something over and over again.  <code class="code">Sqrt-iter</code>, on
the other hand, demonstrates how iteration can be accomplished using no special
construct other than the ordinary ability to call a procedure.<a class="footnote" id="DOCF19" href="#FOOT19"><sup>19</sup></a>

<p><code class="code">Sqrt</code> is our first example of a process defined by a set of mutually
defined procedures.  Notice that the definition of <code class="code">sqrt_iter</code> is
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-recursive-1"></a>
<em class="dfn">recursive</em>; that is, the procedure is defined in terms of itself.  The
idea of being able to define a procedure in terms of itself may be disturbing;
it may seem unclear how such a &#8220;circular&#8221; definition could make sense at all,
much less specify a well-defined process to be carried out by a computer.  This
will be addressed more carefully in <a class="ref" href="1_002e2.xhtml#g_t1_002e2">Procedures and the Processes They Generate</a>.  But first let&#8217;s
consider some other important points illustrated by the <code class="code">sqrt</code> example.
</p>
<p>Observe that the problem of computing square roots breaks up naturally into a
number of subproblems: how to tell whether a guess is good enough, how to
improve a guess, and so on.  Each of these tasks is accomplished by a separate
procedure.  The entire <code class="code">sqrt</code> program can be viewed as a cluster of
procedures (shown in <a class="ref" href="#Figure-1_002e2">Figure 1.2</a>) that mirrors the decomposition of the
problem into subproblems.
</p>
<div class="float">
<a class="anchor" id="Figure-1_002e2"></a><img class="image" src="fig/chap1/Fig1.2.std.svg" alt="fig/chap1/Fig1.2" />
<div class="caption"><p><strong class="strong">Figure 1.2:</strong> Procedural decomposition of the <code class="code">sqrt</code> program.</p></div></div>
<p>The importance of this decomposition strategy is not simply that one is
dividing the program into parts.  After all, we could take any large program
and divide it into parts&#8212;the first ten lines, the next ten lines, the next
ten lines, and so on.  Rather, it is crucial that each procedure accomplishes
an identifiable task that can be used as a module in defining other procedures.
For example, when we define the <code class="code">good_enough</code> procedure in terms of
<code class="code">square</code>, we are able to regard the <code class="code">square</code> procedure as a &#8220;black
box.&#8221;  We are not at that moment concerned with <em class="emph">how</em> the procedure
computes its result, only with the fact that it computes the square.  The
details of how the square is computed can be suppressed, to be considered at a
later time.  Indeed, as far as the <code class="code">good_enough</code> procedure is concerned,
<code class="code">square</code> is not quite a procedure but rather an abstraction of a
procedure, a so-called <a class="index-entry-id" id="index-procedural-abstraction"></a>
<em class="dfn">procedural abstraction</em>.  At this level of
abstraction, any procedure that computes the square is equally good.
</p>
<p>Thus, considering only the values they return, the following two procedures for
squaring a number should be indistinguishable.  Each takes a numerical argument
and produces the square of that number as the value.<a class="footnote" id="DOCF20" href="#FOOT20"><sup>20</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">fn square(x: f64) -&gt; f64 { x * x }

fn square(x: f64) -&gt; f64 {
    (x.ln() * 2.0).exp()
}

fn double(x: f64) -&gt; f64 { x + x }
</pre></div>

<p>So a procedure definition should be able to suppress detail.  The users of the
procedure may not have written the procedure themselves, but may have obtained
it from another programmer as a black box.  A user should not need to know how
the procedure is implemented in order to use it.
</p>
<h4 class="subsubheading" id="Local-names"><span>Local names<a class="copiable-link" href="#Local-names"> &#182;</a></span></h4>

<p>One detail of a procedure&#8217;s implementation that should not matter to the user
of the procedure is the implementer&#8217;s choice of names for the procedure&#8217;s
formal parameters.  Thus, the following procedures should not be
distinguishable:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">fn square(x: i64) -&gt; i64 {
    x * x
}

fn square(y: i64) -&gt; i64 {
    y * y
}
</pre></div>

<p>This principle&#8212;that the meaning of a procedure should be independent of the
parameter names used by its author&#8212;seems on the surface to be self-evident,
but its consequences are profound.  The simplest consequence is that the
parameter names of a procedure must be local to the body of the procedure.  For
example, we used <code class="code">square</code> in the definition of <code class="code">good_enough</code> in our
square-root procedure:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">fn good_enough(guess: f64, x: f64) -&gt; bool {
    (guess.powi(2) - x).abs() &lt; 0.001
}
</pre></div>

<p>The intention of the author of <code class="code">good_enough</code> is to determine if the
square of the first argument is within a given tolerance of the second
argument.  We see that the author of <code class="code">good_enough</code> used the name
<code class="code">guess</code> to refer to the first argument and <code class="code">x</code> to refer to the second
argument.  The argument of <code class="code">square</code> is <code class="code">guess</code>.  If the author of
<code class="code">square</code> used <code class="code">x</code> (as above) to refer to that argument, we see that
the <code class="code">x</code> in <code class="code">good_enough</code> must be a different <code class="code">x</code> than the one
in <code class="code">square</code>.  Running the procedure <code class="code">square</code> must not affect the
value of <code class="code">x</code> that is used by <code class="code">good_enough</code>, because that value of
<code class="code">x</code> may be needed by <code class="code">good_enough</code> after <code class="code">square</code> is done
computing.
</p>
<p>If the parameters were not local to the bodies of their respective procedures,
then the parameter <code class="code">x</code> in <code class="code">square</code> could be confused with the
parameter <code class="code">x</code> in <code class="code">good_enough</code>, and the behavior of
<code class="code">good_enough</code> would depend upon which version of <code class="code">square</code> we used.
Thus, <code class="code">square</code> would not be the black box we desired.
</p>
<p>A formal parameter of a procedure has a very special role in the procedure
definition, in that it doesn&#8217;t matter what name the formal parameter has.  Such
a name is called a <a class="index-entry-id" id="index-bound-variable"></a>
<em class="dfn">bound variable</em>, and we say that the procedure
definition <a class="index-entry-id" id="index-binds"></a>
<em class="dfn">binds</em> its formal parameters.  The meaning of a procedure
definition is unchanged if a bound variable is consistently renamed throughout
the definition.<a class="footnote" id="DOCF21" href="#FOOT21"><sup>21</sup></a>  If a variable is not bound, we say that it is <a class="index-entry-id" id="index-free"></a>
<em class="dfn">free</em>.
The set of expressions for which a binding defines a name is called the
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-scope"></a>
<em class="dfn">scope</em> of that name.  In a procedure definition, the bound variables
declared as the formal parameters of the procedure have the body of the
procedure as their scope.
</p>
<p>In the definition of <code class="code">good_enough</code> above, <code class="code">guess</code> and <code class="code">x</code> are
bound variables but <code class="code">&lt;</code>, <code class="code">-</code>, <code class="code">abs</code>, and <code class="code">square</code> are free.
The meaning of <code class="code">good_enough</code> should be independent of the names we choose
for <code class="code">guess</code> and <code class="code">x</code> so long as they are distinct and different from
<code class="code">&lt;</code>, <code class="code">-</code>, <code class="code">abs</code>, and <code class="code">square</code>.  (If we renamed <code class="code">guess</code>
to <code class="code">abs</code> we would have introduced a bug by <a class="index-entry-id" id="index-capturing"></a>
<em class="dfn">capturing</em> the
variable <code class="code">abs</code>.  It would have changed from free to bound.)  The meaning
of <code class="code">good_enough</code> is not independent of the names of its free variables,
however.  It surely depends upon the fact (external to this definition) that
the symbol <code class="code">abs</code> names a procedure for computing the absolute value of a
number.  <code class="code">Good-enough?</code> will compute a different function if we substitute
<code class="code">cos</code> for <code class="code">abs</code> in its definition.
</p>
<h4 class="subsubheading" id="Internal-definitions-and-block-structure"><span>Internal definitions and block structure<a class="copiable-link" href="#Internal-definitions-and-block-structure"> &#182;</a></span></h4>

<p>We have one kind of name isolation available to us so far: The formal
parameters of a procedure are local to the body of the procedure.  The
square-root program illustrates another way in which we would like to control
the use of names.  The existing program consists of separate procedures:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">fn sqrt(x: f64) -&gt; f64 {
    sqrt_iter(1.0, x)
}

fn sqrt_iter(guess: f64, x: f64) -&gt; f64 {
    if good_enough(guess, x) {
        guess
    } else {
        sqrt_iter(improve(guess, x), x)
    }
}

fn good_enough(guess: f64, x: f64) -&gt; bool {
    (guess.powi(2) - x).abs() &lt; 0.001
}

fn improve(guess: f64, x: f64) -&gt; f64 {
    average(guess, x / guess)
}
</pre></div>

<p>The problem with this program is that the only procedure that is important to
users of <code class="code">sqrt</code> is <code class="code">sqrt</code>.  The other procedures (<code class="code">sqrt-iter</code>,
<code class="code">good_enough</code>, and <code class="code">improve</code>) only clutter up their minds.  They may
not define any other procedure called <code class="code">good_enough</code> as part of another
program to work together with the square-root program, because <code class="code">sqrt</code>
needs it.  The problem is especially severe in the construction of large
systems by many separate programmers.  For example, in the construction of a
large library of numerical procedures, many numerical functions are computed as
successive approximations and thus might have procedures named
<code class="code">good_enough</code> and <code class="code">improve</code> as auxiliary procedures.  We would like
to localize the subprocedures, hiding them inside <code class="code">sqrt</code> so that
<code class="code">sqrt</code> could coexist with other successive approximations, each having its
own private <code class="code">good_enough</code> procedure.  To make this possible, we allow a
procedure to have internal definitions that are local to that procedure.  For
example, in the square-root problem we can write
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">fn sqrt(x: f64) -&gt; f64 {
    fn good_enough(guess: f64, x: f64) -&gt; bool {
        (guess.powi(2) - x).abs() &lt; 0.001
    }
    fn improve(guess: f64, x: f64) -&gt; f64 {
        average(guess, x / guess)
    }
    fn sqrt_iter(guess: f64, x: f64) -&gt; f64 {
        if good_enough(guess, x) {
            guess
        } else {
            sqrt_iter(improve(guess, x), x)
        }
    }
    sqrt_iter(1.0, x)
}
</pre></div>

<p>Such nesting of definitions, called <a class="index-entry-id" id="index-block-structure"></a>
<em class="dfn">block structure</em>, is basically the
right solution to the simplest name-packaging problem.  But there is a better
idea lurking here.  In addition to internalizing the definitions of the
auxiliary procedures, we can simplify them.  Since <code class="code">x</code> is bound in the
definition of <code class="code">sqrt</code>, the procedures <code class="code">good_enough</code>, <code class="code">improve</code>,
and <code class="code">sqrt-iter</code>, which are defined internally to <code class="code">sqrt</code>, are in the
scope of <code class="code">x</code>.  Thus, it is not necessary to pass <code class="code">x</code> explicitly to
each of these procedures.  Instead, we allow <code class="code">x</code> to be a free variable in
the internal definitions, as shown below. Then <code class="code">x</code> gets its value from the
argument with which the enclosing procedure <code class="code">sqrt</code> is called.  This
discipline is called <a class="index-entry-id" id="index-lexical-scoping"></a>
<em class="dfn">lexical scoping</em>.<a class="footnote" id="DOCF22" href="#FOOT22"><sup>22</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">fn sqrt(x: f64) -&gt; f64 {
    let good_enough = |guess: f64| {
        (guess.powi(2) - x).abs() &lt; 0.001
    };
    let improve = |guess: f64| {
        (guess + x / guess) / 2.0
    };
    let mut guess = 1.0;
    while !good_enough(guess) {
        guess = improve(guess);
    }
    guess
}

<p>We will use block structure extensively to help us break up large
programs into tractable pieces.<a class="footnote" id="DOCF23" href="#FOOT23"><sup>23</sup></a>
The idea of block structure originated with the programming language
Algol 60. It appears in most advanced programming languages and is an
important tool for helping to organize the construction of large

<h5 class="footnote-body-heading"><a id="FOOT1" href="#DOCF1">(1)</a></h5>
<p>The characterization of
numbers as &#8220;simple data&#8221; is a barefaced bluff.  In fact, the treatment of
numbers is one of the trickiest and most confusing aspects of any programming
language.  Some typical issues involved are these: Some computer systems
distinguish <a class="index-entry-id" id="index-integers"></a>
<em class="dfn">integers</em>, such as 2, from <a class="index-entry-id" id="index-real-numbers"></a>
<em class="dfn">real numbers</em>, such as
2.71.  Is the real number 2.00 different from the integer 2?  Are the
arithmetic operations used for integers the same as the operations used for
real numbers?  Does 6 divided by 2 produce 3, or 3.0?  How large a number can
we represent?  How many decimal places of accuracy can we represent?  Is the
range of integers the same as the range of real numbers?  Above and beyond
these questions, of course, lies a collection of issues concerning roundoff and
truncation errors&#8212;the entire science of numerical analysis.  Since our focus
in this book is on large-scale program design rather than on numerical
techniques, we are going to ignore these problems.  The numerical examples in
this chapter will exhibit the usual roundoff behavior that one observes when
using arithmetic operations that preserve a limited number of decimal places of
accuracy in noninteger operations.</p>
<h5 class="footnote-body-heading"><a id="FOOT2" href="#DOCF2">(2)</a></h5>
<p>Throughout this book, when
we wish to emphasize the distinction between the input typed by the user and
the response printed by the interpreter, we will show the latter in slanted
characters.</p>
<h5 class="footnote-body-heading"><a id="FOOT3" href="#DOCF3">(3)</a></h5>
<p>Rust development tools typically provide features to aid the user in
formatting expressions.  Two especially useful features are automatic formatting
with tools like <code class="code">rustfmt</code>, and syntax highlighting that helps visually
parse complex nested expressions with matching parentheses.</p>
<h5 class="footnote-body-heading"><a id="FOOT4" href="#DOCF4">(4)</a></h5>
<p>Rust obeys the
convention that every expression has a value. This is a fundamental principle
in Rust&#8217;s design, where nearly everything is an expression that evaluates to
a value, including blocks, <code class="code">if</code> statements, and <code class="code">match</code> expressions.</p>
<h5 class="footnote-body-heading"><a id="FOOT5" href="#DOCF5">(5)</a></h5>
<p>In this book, we do not show the interpreter&#8217;s response
to evaluating definitions, since this is highly implementation-dependent.</p>
<h5 class="footnote-body-heading"><a id="FOOT6" href="#DOCF6">(6)</a></h5>
<p><a class="ref" href="Chapter-3.xhtml">Modularity, Objects, and State</a> will show that this notion of
environment is crucial, both for understanding how the interpreter works and
for implementing interpreters.</p>
<h5 class="footnote-body-heading"><a id="FOOT7" href="#DOCF7">(7)</a></h5>
<p>It may seem strange that
the evaluation rule says, as part of the first step, that we should evaluate
the leftmost element of a combination, since at this point that can only be an
operator such as <code class="code">+</code> or <code class="code">*</code> representing a built-in primitive
procedure such as addition or multiplication.  We will see later that it is
useful to be able to work with combinations whose operators are themselves
compound expressions.</p>
<h5 class="footnote-body-heading"><a id="FOOT8" href="#DOCF8">(8)</a></h5>
<p>Special syntactic forms that are simply convenient
alternative surface structures for things that can be written in more uniform
ways are sometimes called <a class="index-entry-id" id="index-syntactic-sugar"></a>
<em class="dfn">syntactic sugar</em>, to use a phrase coined by
Peter Landin.  Rust uses syntactic sugar to make common patterns easier to write
and read, such as the <code class="code">for</code> loop, which is sugar for an iterator-based loop.</p>
<h5 class="footnote-body-heading"><a id="FOOT9" href="#DOCF9">(9)</a></h5>
<p>Observe that there are two different operations being
combined here: we are creating the procedure, and we are giving it the name
<code class="code">square</code>.  It is possible, indeed important, to be able to separate these
two notions&#8212;to create procedures without naming them, and to give names to
procedures that have already been created.  We will see how to do this in
<a class="ref" href="1_002e3.xhtml#g_t1_002e3_002e2">Constructing Procedures Using Closures</a>.</p>
<h5 class="footnote-body-heading"><a id="FOOT10" href="#DOCF10">(10)</a></h5>
<p>Throughout this book, we will describe the general
syntax of expressions by using italic symbols delimited by angle
brackets&#8212;e.g., <code class="code">⟨</code><var class="var">name</var><code class="code">⟩</code>&#8212;to denote the &#8220;slots&#8221; in the expression to be
filled in when such an expression is actually used.</p>
<h5 class="footnote-body-heading"><a id="FOOT11" href="#DOCF11">(11)</a></h5>
<p>More generally, the body of the procedure can be a
sequence of expressions.  In this case, the compiler evaluates each
expression in the sequence in turn and returns the value of the final
expression as the value of the procedure application.</p>
<h5 class="footnote-body-heading"><a id="FOOT12" href="#DOCF12">(12)</a></h5>
<p>&#8220;Interpreted as either true or false&#8221; means
this: In Rust, there are two distinguished values of type <code class="code">bool</code> denoted by the
constants <code class="code">true</code> and <code class="code">false</code>.  When the compiler checks a predicate&#8217;s
value, it interprets <code class="code">false</code> as false and <code class="code">true</code> as true. Unlike Scheme,
Rust requires predicates to be explicitly of type <code class="code">bool</code> and does not
implicitly convert other values to boolean.</p>
<h5 class="footnote-body-heading"><a id="FOOT13" href="#DOCF13">(13)</a></h5>
<p><code class="code">Abs</code> also uses the &#8220;minus&#8221; operator <code class="code">-</code>,
which, when used as a unary prefix operator, as in <code class="code">-x</code>, indicates
negation.</p>
<h5 class="footnote-body-heading"><a id="FOOT14" href="#DOCF14">(14)</a></h5>
<p>In Rust, both the <code class="code">⟨</code><var class="var">consequent</var><code class="code">⟩</code> and
<code class="code">⟨</code><var class="var">alternative</var><code class="code">⟩</code> blocks can contain sequences of statements.
If a block contains multiple statements, they are evaluated in sequence and
the value of the final expression (without a semicolon) in the block is
returned as the value of the block.</p>
<h5 class="footnote-body-heading"><a id="FOOT15" href="#DOCF15">(15)</a></h5>
<p>Declarative
and imperative descriptions are intimately related, as indeed are mathematics
and computer science.  For instance, to say that the answer produced by a
program is &#8220;correct&#8221; is to make a declarative statement about the program.
There is a large amount of research aimed at establishing techniques for
proving that programs are correct, and much of the technical difficulty of this
subject has to do with negotiating the transition between imperative statements
(from which programs are constructed) and declarative statements (which can be
used to deduce things).  In a related vein, an important current area in
programming-language design is the exploration of so-called very high-level
languages, in which one actually programs in terms of declarative statements.
The idea is to make interpreters sophisticated enough so that, given &#8220;what
is&#8221; knowledge specified by the programmer, they can generate &#8220;how to&#8221;
knowledge automatically.  This cannot be done in general, but there are
important areas where progress has been made.  We shall revisit this idea in
<a class="ref" href="Chapter-4.xhtml">Metalinguistic Abstraction</a>.</p>
<h5 class="footnote-body-heading"><a id="FOOT16" href="#DOCF16">(16)</a></h5>
<p>This square-root algorithm
is actually a special case of Newton&#8217;s method, which is a general technique for
finding roots of equations.  The square-root algorithm itself was developed by
Heron of Alexandria in the first century <abbr class="abbr">A.D.</abbr>  We will see how to
express the general Newton&#8217;s method as a Rust procedure in <a class="ref" href="1_002e3.xhtml#g_t1_002e3_002e4">Procedures as Returned Values</a>.</p>
<h5 class="footnote-body-heading"><a id="FOOT17" href="#DOCF17">(17)</a></h5>
<p>In Lisp, it is common to give
predicates names ending with question marks (e.g., <code class="code">good_enough</code>).
In Rust, the convention is to use a verb prefix like <code class="code">is_</code> or simply use a
descriptive name that implies a boolean return value. Question marks are not
allowed in Rust identifiers; they are reserved for the <code class="code">?</code> operator.</p>
<h5 class="footnote-body-heading"><a id="FOOT18" href="#DOCF18">(18)</a></h5>
<p>Observe that we express our initial guess as 1.0 rather than 1.
In Rust, this distinction is critical because <code class="code">1</code> is an integer (<code class="code">i32</code>)
and <code class="code">1.0</code> is a floating-point number (<code class="code">f64</code>). Rust does not support
implicit type conversion (coercion) between integers and floats. If we used
<code class="code">1</code>, we would get a compilation error when trying to use it in functions
expecting <code class="code">f64</code>. In Scheme, the distinction often led to exact rational
arithmetic versus inexact decimal arithmetic.</p>

<p>It is not even
clear which of these procedures is a more efficient implementation.  This
depends upon the hardware available.  There are machines for which the
&#8220;obvious&#8221; implementation is the less efficient one.  Consider a machine that
has extensive tables of logarithms and antilogarithms stored in a very
efficient manner.</p>

consequences of running programs that intertwine definition and use.</p>
